Finance,Discounted cash flow,"In finance, discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis is a method of valuing a security, project, company, or asset using the concepts of the time value of money. 
Discounted cash flow analysis is widely used in investment finance, real estate development, corporate financial management and patent valuation. It was used in industry as early as the 1700s or 1800s, widely discussed in financial economics in the 1960s, and became widely used in U.S. courts in the 1980s and 1990s.",3
Finance,Real versus nominal value (economics),"In economics, nominal value is measured in terms of money, whereas real value is measured against goods or services. A real value is one which has been adjusted for inflation, enabling comparison of quantities as if the prices of goods had not changed on average. Changes in value in real terms therefore exclude the effect of inflation. In contrast with a real value, a nominal value has not been adjusted for inflation, and so changes in nominal value reflect at least in part the effect of inflation.",3
Finance,Continuous accounting,"Continuous accounting is an approach to managing the accounting cycle that can be the key to achieving a more strategic finance and accounting function in a corporation. It is designed to be a practical approach that addresses the tactical issues that prevent finance departments from being more strategic. Continuous accounting embraces three main principles:
The first is the need to automate mechanical, repetitive accounting processes in a continuous, end-to-end fashion. Managing processes in a controlled, end-to-end fashion improves efficiency and it ensures data integrity. Ensuring data integrity is crucial because the absence of data integrity is the root cause of a lot of time-consuming work that departments perform that adds little value to the rest of the company.The second is optimizing the accounting calendar by distributing workloads continuously and evenly over the accounting period (the month, quarter or year) to eliminate bottlenecks and optimize when and in which order accounting tasks are performed.The third is establishing a culture of continuous improvement in managing the accounting cycle. A continuous improvement culture sets increasingly rigorous objectives, reviews performance to those objectives frequently and makes addressing performance shortcomings a departmental priority.Continuous accounting requires the effective use of information (data) and technology (software) to automate accounting and finance processes in an end-to-end fashion. This does not mean that every step is entirely hands-off, but processes are designed to automate the execution of as many steps as is practical. It also involves automating all the hand-offs that take place between people in performing the process as well as any managing all administrative and approval steps that must take place. End-to-end automation has two objectives. One is to cut down on the time employees spend doing work that computers can do faster and more consistently. The second is to improve the quality of the data in a company's financial records to ensure greater accuracy, consistency and control of financial data. In this respect, continuous accounting supports the COSO Framework.
Automation improves data quality because eliminating human intervention in the handling of data substantially reduces the potential for errors in a well-controlled IT environment. Consequently, by design, end-to-end financial process automation strengthens financial controls and facilitates auditing. Spreadsheets and manual calculations create the need for time-consuming reconciliations and checks to spot errors and identify their source.  
An important design objective for end-to-end automation is to ensure that there is a single authoritative source for the data that is used in accounting processes. Technology exists to ensures that even with multiple accounting and financial management systems and data stores, there is no duplication of data that requires checks and reconciliations.
To second component of continuous accounting focuses on optimizing workloads. Increasingly, financial software gives companies greater flexibility. The classic accounting calendar with its monthly, quarterly and annual cycles developed over centuries as a practical approach to dealing with the limitations of the paper based systems and manual calculations. Their frequency represents a trade-off aimed at balancing efficiency and control: waiting until there are enough entries to justify performing the work, but not waiting too long to identify fraud, procedural issues and accounting errors. The monthly accounting close developed for many accounting tasks because a weekly cadence proved to be too short a period to be efficient while quarterly was too long to wait. Other accounting processes are typically handled on a quarterly or semi-annual basis because this longer frequency reflects a more appropriate trade-off of efficiency and control.
Even when computers were first used to automate bookkeeping and accounting, the old accounting calendars persisted. The limitations of early business computing technology forced system designers to use batch processing. From an accounting process standpoint, batch systems do not offer much of an improvement over paper-based ones in changing the timing of finance and accounting processes. They impose the same need to balance efficiency and control in taking computing systems off-line to handle computations and summarizations in a way that does not interfere with transactions processing. Only within the past decade has information technology reached a performance threshold that eliminates the need for such batch processing.  Corporations that use batch-less accounting systems have greater freedom to schedule their accounting cycle.  
The third principle of continuous accounting is continuous (or continual) improvement. Decades ago, continuous improvement revolutionized manufacturing worldwide and culture of manufacturing departments. Continuous improvement can be used as a management approach to overcome organizational inertia. This is particularly difficult in accounting departments because accounting is a discipline that requires consistency, which is necessary for the faithful presentation of a company's financial performance and health. But performing accounting processes the same way may not be the best way.
Continuous improvement requires ongoing assessments to identify issues and how to address them, as well as a mindset that accepts that these sorts of changes will be made.",3
Finance,Finance,"Finance is the study of money and assets. It is intertwined but not the same with economics, the study of production, distribution, and consumption of money, assets, goods and services. Finance activities take place in financial systems at various scopes, thus the field can be roughly divided into personal, corporate, and public finance. In a financial system, assets are bought, sold, and traded as financial instruments, such as currencies, loans, bonds, shares, stocks, options, futures, etc. Assets can also be banked, invested, and insured to maximize value and minimize loss. In practice, risks are always present in any financial action and entities.
Many subfields within finance are formed due to its wide scope. Asset, money, risk and investment management aim to maximize value and reduce volatility. Financial analysis is viability, stability, and profitability assessment of an action or entity. In some cases, theories in finance can be tested using the scientific method, covered by experimental finance. Some fields are multidisciplinary, such as mathematical finance, financial law, financial economics, financial engineering and financial technology. These fields are the foundation of business and accounting.
The history of finance may begin with the history of money, which is prehistoric. Ancient and medieval civilizations are known to have done basic finance functions, such as banking, trading, and accounting. Qualitative finance theories were first proposed in the 20th century, starting with Louis Bachelier's thesis. In the late 20th and early 21st century, the global financial system was formed.",3
Finance,PERC Reporting Standard,"The PERC Standard for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (the ‘PERC Reporting Standard’) sets out the minimum standards, as well as additional guidelines and recommendations for the Public Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves within Europe.
It applies to all solid mineral raw materials for which Public Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves is required by any relevant regulatory authority.
The PERC Reporting Standard is fully aligned with the CRIRSCO International Reporting Template.The CRIRSCO International Reporting Template is a document that represents the best of the CRIRSCO-style codes for the public reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves that are recognised and adopted world-wide for market-related reporting and financial investment.",3
Finance,Direct costs,"Direct costs are costs which are directly accountable to a cost object (such as a particular project, facility, function or product). Direct cost is the nomenclature used in accounting. The equivalent nomenclature in economics is specific cost. By contrast, a joint cost is a cost incurred in the production or delivery of multiple products or product lines. For instance, in civil aviation, substantial costs of a flight (pilots, fuel, wear and tear on the plane, landing and takeoff fees) are a joint cost between carrying passengers and carrying freight, and underlie economies of scope across passenger and freight services. By contrast, some costs are specific to the services, for instance, meals and flight attendants are specific costs of carrying passengers.
Direct costs are directly attributable to the object. In construction, the costs of materials, labor, equipment, etc., and all directly involved efforts or expenses for the cost object are direct costs. In manufacturing or other non-construction industries, the portion of operating costs which is directly assignable to a specific product or process is a direct cost. Direct costs are those for activities or services that benefit specific projects, for example salaries for project staff and materials required for a particular project. Because these activities are easily traced to projects, their costs are usually charged to projects on an item-by-item basis.
The economics term for the same concept is specific cost.Direct costs typically include:

Direct materials used in manufacturing
Direct labour
Direct expenses, e.g. a royalty payment to a patent holder for a specific production process",3
Finance,Chepakovich valuation model,"The Chepakovich valuation model is a specialized discounted cash flow valuation model, originally designed for the valuation of “growth stocks” (ordinary/common shares of companies experiencing high revenue growth rates), and subsequently applied to the valuation of high-tech companies - even those that are (currently) unprofitable. 
Relatedly, it is a general valuation model and can also be applied to no-growth or negative growth companies. 
In fact, in the limiting case of no growth in revenues, the model yields similar (but not identical) results to a regular discounted cash flow to equity model. 
The model was developed by Alexander Chepakovich in 2000 and enhanced in subsequent years.",3
Finance,Equivalence in financial services (European Union),"The principle of equivalence in financial services at the European Union (EU) level is one of the instruments the Commission has at its disposal to carry out its international strategy for financial services. The principle of equivalence is materialised through an equivalence decision issued by the European Commission to a targeted country that it judges fit to have access to the European Market in financial services. The decision is unilateral, non-reciprocal and affects the targeted third country in regard to particular activities or services to which the decision is intended.  The equivalence decision is issued through an assessment of the third country regulations in relation to particular services or activities in the EU. In order to do so, the Commission bases its decision on 40 provisions of EU law. Important to note, perhaps is the fact that not all have been availed but over 250 equivalence decisions were made targeting more than 30 countries worldwide.According to the European Commission, the aim of the equivalence decision is not to liberalise international trade in financial services, but a cross-border instrument to manage financial activity of market players in a way that respects standards of prudential rules as the EU does internationally.There is a recognition that equivalence has become a significant tool in the EU and one of the main powers of the Commission when it comes to financial services. In his speech, Valdis Dombrovskis, the Commissioner responsible for financial services, has highlighted the efficiency of the policy. In the occasion, he took the opportunity to talk about the new EU's comprehensive approach and legislative improvements for the granting of equivalence to third countries. In addition, it outlines the way the Commission and the European Supervisory Authorities monitor the situation in the countries to which an equivalence decision has been taken.",3
Finance,Transactional Asset Pricing Approach (TAPA),"In the valuation theory department of economics, the Transactional Asset Pricing Approach (TAPA) is a general reconstruction of asset pricing theory developed in 2000s by a collaboration of Russian and Israeli economists Vladimir B. Michaletz and Andrey I. Artemenkov. It provides a basis for reconstructing the discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and the resulting income capitalization techniques, such as the Gordon growth formula (see dividend discount model ), from a transactional perspective relying, in the process, on a formulated dynamic principle of transactional equity-in-exchange.",3
Finance,Total Beta,"Business valuation is a process and a set of procedures used to estimate the economic value of an owner's interest in a business.  Here various valuation techniques are used by financial market participants to determine the price they are willing to pay or receive to effect a sale of the business.
In addition to estimating the selling price of a business, the same valuation tools are often used by business appraisers to resolve disputes related to estate and gift taxation, divorce litigation, allocate business purchase price among business assets, establish a formula for estimating the value of partners' ownership interest for buy-sell agreements, and many other business and legal purposes such as in shareholders deadlock, divorce litigation and estate contest.Specialized business valuation credentials include the Chartered Business Valuator (CBV) offered by the CBV Institute, ASA and CEIV from the American Society of Appraisers, and the CVA by the National Association of Certified Valuators and Analysts. 
In some cases, the court would appoint a forensic accountant as the joint-expert doing the business valuation.  Here, attorneys should always be prepared to have their expert's report withstand the scrutiny of cross-examination and criticism. Business valuation is distinct from stock valuation, which is about calculating theoretical values of listed companies and their stocks, for the purposes of share trading and investment management. 
This distinction extends to the use of the results: stock investors intend to profit from price movement, whereas a business owner is focused on the enterprise as a total, going concern.
A further distinction is re corporate finance: 
the transactions here are generally handled by a business broker; 
whereas where two corporates are involved, the transaction and valuation is within the realm of ""mergers and acquisitions"", and is handled by an investment bank; see Mergers and acquisitions § Business valuation and Corporate finance § Investment and project valuation.",3
Finance,Herfindahl–Hirschman index,"The Herfindahl index (also known as Herfindahl–Hirschman Index, HHI, or sometimes HHI-score) is a measure of the size of firms in relation to the industry they are in and is an indicator of the amount of competition among them.  Named after economists Orris C. Herfindahl and Albert O. Hirschman, it is an economic concept widely applied in competition law, antitrust and also technology management. HHI has continued to be used by antitrust authorities, primarily to evaluate and understand how mergers will affect their associated markets. HHI is calculated by squaring the market share of each competing firm in the industry and then summing the resulting numbers,(sometimes limited to the 50 largest firms), market shares are expressed as either fractions, decimals, or whole numbers. The result is proportional to the average market share, weighted by market share. As such, it can range from 0 to 1.0, moving from a huge number of very small firms to a single monopolistic producer. Increases in the Herfindahl index generally indicate a decrease in competition and an increase of market power, whereas decreases indicate the opposite. Alternatively, if whole percentages are used, the index ranges from 0 to 10,000 ""points"".  For example, an index of .25 is the same as 2,500 points.
The major benefit of the Herfindahl index in relationship to such measures as the concentration ratio is that it gives more weight to larger firms. Other benefits of the Herfindahl index includes its simple calculation method and the small amount of easily obtainable data required for the calculation.The measure is the same formula as the Simpson diversity index, which is a diversity index used in ecology; the inverse participation ratio (IPR) in physics; and the effective number of parties index in politics.",3
Finance,Expertization,"Expertization is the process of authentication of an object, usually of a sort that is collected, by an individual authority or a committee of authorities. The expert, or expert committee, examines the collectible and issues a certificate typically including:

A statement of:
Whether or not the item is authentic
Identification of any damage to the item
Identification of any repairs to the item
Identification of any forgery or faked parts of the item
A photo of the itemSome experts apply a mark or signature to the item attesting its genuineness.
Expertization is particularly common with valuable philatelic items, some of which are so often forged that they may be unsaleable without it.",3
Finance,Bookkeeping,"Bookkeeping is the recording of financial transactions, and is part of the process of accounting in business and other organizations. It involves preparing source documents for all transactions, operations, and other events of a business. Transactions include purchases, sales, receipts and payments by an individual person or an organization/corporation. There are several standard methods of bookkeeping, including the single-entry and double-entry bookkeeping systems. While these may be viewed as ""real"" bookkeeping, any process for recording financial transactions is a bookkeeping process.
The person in an organisation who is employed to perform bookkeeping functions is usually called the bookkeeper (or book-keeper). They usually write the daybooks (which contain records of sales, purchases, receipts, and payments), and document each financial transaction, whether cash or credit, into the correct daybook—that is, petty cash book, suppliers ledger, customer ledger, etc.—and the general ledger. Thereafter, an accountant can create financial reports from the information recorded by the bookkeeper. The bookkeeper brings the books to the trial balance stage, from which an accountant may prepare financial reports  for the organisation, such as the income statement and balance sheet.",3

Technology,Robotic process automation,"Robotic process automation (RPA) is a form of business process automation technology based on metaphorical software robots (bots) or on artificial intelligence (AI)/digital workers.  It is sometimes referred to as software robotics (not to be confused with robot software).
In traditional workflow automation tools, a software developer produces a list of actions to automate a task and interface to the back end system using internal application programming interfaces (APIs) or dedicated scripting language. In contrast, RPA systems develop the action list by watching the user perform that task in the application's graphical user interface (GUI), and then perform the automation by repeating those tasks directly in the GUI. This can lower the barrier to the use of automation in products that might not otherwise feature APIs for this purpose.
RPA tools have strong technical similarities to graphical user interface testing tools. These tools also automate interactions with the GUI, and often do so by repeating a set of demonstration actions performed by a user. RPA tools differ from such systems in that they allow data to be handled in and between multiple applications, for instance, receiving email containing an invoice, extracting the data, and then typing that into a bookkeeping system.

Technology,Overfitting,"In mathematical modeling, overfitting is ""the production of an analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data, and may therefore fail to fit to additional data or predict future observations reliably"". An overfitted model is a mathematical model that contains more parameters than can be justified by the data. The essence of overfitting is to have unknowingly extracted some of the residual variation (i.e., the noise) as if that variation represented underlying model structure.: 45 Underfitting occurs when a mathematical model cannot adequately capture the underlying structure of the data. An under-fitted model is a model where some parameters or terms that would appear in a correctly specified model are missing. Under-fitting would occur, for example, when fitting a linear model to non-linear data. Such a model will tend to have poor predictive performance.
The possibility of over-fitting exists because the criterion used for selecting the model is not the same as the criterion used to judge the suitability of a model. For example, a model might be selected by maximizing its performance on some set of training data, and yet its suitability might be determined by its ability to perform well on unseen data; then over-fitting occurs when a model begins to ""memorize"" training data rather than ""learning"" to generalize from a trend. 
As an extreme example, if the number of parameters is the same as or greater than the number of observations, then a model can perfectly predict the training data simply by memorizing the data in its entirety. (For an illustration, see Figure 2.) Such a model, though, will typically fail severely when making predictions. 
The potential for overfitting depends not only on the number of parameters and data but also the conformability of the model structure with the data shape, and the magnitude of model error compared to the expected level of noise or error in the data. Even when the fitted model does not have an excessive number of parameters, it is to be expected that the fitted relationship will appear to perform less well on a new data set than on the data set used for fitting (a phenomenon sometimes known as shrinkage). In particular, the value of the coefficient of determination will shrink relative to the original data.
To lessen the chance or amount of overfitting, several techniques are available (e.g., model comparison, cross-validation, regularization, early stopping, pruning, Bayesian priors, or dropout). The basis of some techniques is either (1) to explicitly penalize overly complex models or (2) to test the model's ability to generalize by evaluating its performance on a set of data not used for training, which is assumed to approximate the typical unseen data that a model will encounter.

Technology,Research software engineering,"Research software engineering is the use of software engineering practices in research applications. The term was proposed in a research paper in 2010 in response to an empirical survey on tools used for software development in research projects.

This focuses on reproducibility, reusability, and accuracy  of data analysis and applications created for research.",2
Technology,Reverse engineering,"Reverse engineering (also known as backwards engineering or back engineering) is a process or method through which one attempts to understand through deductive reasoning how a previously made device, process, system, or piece of software accomplishes a task with very little (if any) insight into exactly how it does so.
Reverse engineering is applicable in the fields of computer engineering, mechanical engineering, design, electronic engineering, software engineering, chemical engineering, and systems biology.",2
Technology,Fabric of Security,"The Fabric of Security, also known as Cyber Security Fabric or Federated Security, refers to systems designed to protect the Information Systems infrastructure of the home, a corporation or government from malicious attackers. Protection in this sense means guaranteeing the confidentiality, integrity, and the availability of the information stored in the system (""SYSTEM""), and its elements or components.
Unlike endpoint security, network security, web application security, and Internet security, Fabric of Security Systems assume that attacks will be successful, and cannot be averted. Therefore, the emphasis shifts from attempting to prevent unauthorized access to that of minimizing the time to detect the unauthorized access, the time to isolate the unauthorized access from doing harm, and finally, the time to remove the offending process and reconfiguration of the system back into a ""SAFE"" state.",2
Technology,Computer security incident management,"In the fields of computer security and information technology, computer security incident management involves the monitoring and detection of security events on a computer or computer network, and the execution of proper responses to those events. Computer security incident management is a specialized form of incident management, the primary purpose of which is the development of a well understood and predictable response to damaging events and computer intrusions.Incident management requires a process and a response team which follows this process.  This definition of computer security incident management follows the standards and definitions described in the National Incident Management System (NIMS). The incident coordinator manages the response to an emergency security incident.  In a Natural Disaster or other event requiring response from Emergency services, the incident coordinator would act as a liaison to the emergency services incident manager.

Technology,Bayesian regret,"In stochastic game theory, Bayesian regret is the expected difference (""regret"") between the utility of a Bayesian strategy and that of the optimal strategy (the one with the highest expected payoff). 
The term Bayesian refers to Thomas Bayes (1702–1761), who proved a special case of what is now called Bayes' theorem, who provided the first mathematical treatment of a non-trivial problem of statistical data analysis using what is now known as Bayesian inference.",2
Technology,Nearest neighbor search,"Nearest neighbor search (NNS), as a form of proximity search,  is the optimization problem of finding the point in a given set that is closest (or most similar) to a given point. Closeness is typically expressed in terms of a dissimilarity function: the less similar the objects, the larger the function values. 
Formally, the nearest-neighbor (NN) search problem is defined as follows: given a set S of points in a space M and a query point q ∈ M, find the closest point in S to q. Donald Knuth in vol. 3 of The Art of Computer Programming (1973) called it the post-office problem, referring to an application of assigning to a residence the nearest post office. A direct generalization of this problem is a k-NN search, where we need to find the k closest points.
Most commonly M is a  metric space and dissimilarity is expressed as a distance metric, which is symmetric and satisfies the triangle inequality. Even more common, M is taken to be the d-dimensional vector space where dissimilarity is measured using the Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance or other distance metric. However, the dissimilarity function can be arbitrary. One example is asymmetric Bregman divergence, for which the triangle inequality does not hold.",2
Technology,Multi-task learning,"Multi-task learning (MTL) is a subfield of machine learning in which multiple learning tasks are solved at the same time, while exploiting commonalities and differences across tasks. This can result in improved learning efficiency and prediction accuracy for the task-specific models, when compared to training the models separately. Early versions of MTL were called ""hints"".
In a widely cited 1997 paper, Rich Caruana gave the following characterization:Multitask Learning is an approach to inductive transfer that improves generalization by using the domain information contained in the training signals of related tasks as an inductive bias. It does this by learning tasks in parallel while using a shared representation; what is learned for each task can help other tasks be learned better.
In the classification context, MTL aims to improve the performance of multiple classification tasks by learning them jointly. One example is a spam-filter, which can be treated as distinct but related classification tasks across different users. To make this more concrete, consider that different people have different distributions of features which distinguish spam emails from legitimate ones, for example an English speaker may find that all emails in Russian are spam, not so for Russian speakers. Yet there is a definite commonality in this classification task across users, for example one common feature might be text related to money transfer. Solving each user's spam classification problem jointly via MTL can let the solutions inform each other and improve performance. Further examples of settings for MTL include multiclass classification and multi-label classification.Multi-task learning works because regularization induced by requiring an algorithm to perform well on a related task can be superior to regularization that prevents overfitting by penalizing all complexity uniformly. One situation where MTL may be particularly helpful is if the tasks share significant commonalities and are generally slightly under sampled. However, as discussed below, MTL has also been shown to be beneficial for learning unrelated tasks.",2

Technology,Cybercrime,"Cybercrime is a crime that involves a computer and a network. The computer may have been used in the commission of a crime, or it may be the target. Cybercrime may harm someone's security and financial health.There are many privacy concerns surrounding cybercrime when confidential information is intercepted or disclosed, lawfully or otherwise. Internationally, both governmental and non-state actors engage in cybercrimes, including espionage, financial theft, and other cross-border crimes. Cybercrimes crossing international borders and involving the actions of at least one nation-state are sometimes referred to as cyberwarfare. Warren Buffett describes cybercrime as the ""number one problem with mankind"" and ""poses real risks to humanity.""A report (sponsored by McAfee) published in 2014 estimated that the annual damage to the global economy was $445 billion. A 2016 report by Cybersecurity Ventures predicted that global damages incurred as a result of cybercrime would cost up to $6 trillion annually by 2021 and $10.5 trillion annually by 2025.Approximately $1.5 billion was lost in 2012 to online credit and debit card fraud in the US. In 2018, a study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), in partnership with McAfee, concludes that nearly one percent of global GDP, close to $600 billion, is lost to cybercrime each year. The World Economic Forum 2020 Global Risk report confirmed that organized Cybercrimes bodies are joining forces to perpetrate criminal activities online while estimating the likelihood of their detection and prosecution to be less than 1 percent in the US.",2

Life Science,Spatial transcriptomics,"Spatial transcriptomics is an overarching term for a range of methods designed for assigning cell types (identified by the mRNA readouts) to their locations in the histological sections. This method can also be used to determine subcellular localization of mRNA molecules. The term is a variation of Spatial Genomics, first described by Doyle, et al., in 2000  and then expanded upon by Ståhl et al. in a technique developed in 2016, which has since undergone a variety of improvements and modifications.The Ståhl method implies positioning individual tissue samples on the arrays of spatially barcoded reverse transcription primers able to capture mRNA with the oligo(dT) tails. Besides oligo(dT) tail and spatial barcode, which indicates the x and y position on the arrayed slide, the probe contains a cleavage site, amplification and sequencing handle, and unique molecular identifier. Commonly, histological samples are cut using cryotome, then fixed, stained, and put on the microarrays. After that, it undergoes enzymatic permeabilization, so that molecules can diffuse down to the slide, with further mRNA release and binding to the probes. Reverse transcription is then carried out in situ. As a result, spatially marked complementary DNA is synthesized, providing information about gene expression in the exact location of the sample. Thus, described protocol combines paralleled sequencing and staining of the same sample. It is important to mention that the first generation of the arrayed slides comprised about 1,000 spots of the 100-μm diameter, limiting resolution to ~10-40 cells per spot.In the broader meaning of this term, spatial transcriptomics includes methods that can be divided into five principal approaches to resolving spatial distribution of transcripts. They are microdissection techniques, Fluorescent in situ hybridization methods, in situ sequencing, in situ capture protocols and in silico approaches.Application
Defining the spatial distribution of mRNA molecules allows for the experimentalist to uncover cellular heterogeneity in tissues, tumours, immune cells as well as determine the subcellular distribution of transcripts in various conditions. This information provides a unique opportunity to decipher both the cellular and subcellular architecture in both tissues and individual cells. These methodologies provide crucial insights in the fields of embryology, oncology, immunology and histology. The functioning of the individual cells in multicellular organisms can only be completely explained in the context of identifying their exact location in the body. Spatial transcriptomics techniques sought to elucidate cells’ properties this way. Below, we look into the methods that connect gene expression to the spatial organization of  cells.",1
Life Science,Canopy soils,"Canopy soils, also known as arboreal soils, exist in areas of the canopy in a forests where branches, crevices, or some other physical feature on a tree can accumulate organic matter, such as leaves or fine branches. Eventually, this organic matter weathers into some semblance of a soil, and can reach depths of 30 cm in some temperate rainforests.Epiphytes can take root in this thin soil, which accelerates the development of the soil by adding organic material and physically breaking up material with their root system. Common epiphytes in the canopy soils in temperate rainforests include mosses, ferns, and lichens. Epiphytes on trees in the temperate zone are often ubiquitous and can cover entire trees. Some host trees house up to 6.5 tons dry weight of epiphytic biomass, which can equate to more than 4x of its own foliar mass. This massive presence means their dynamics need to be better understood in order to fully understand forest dynamics.  The nutrients that become stored within canopy soils can then be utilized by the epiphytes that grow in them, and even the tree that the canopy soil is accumulating in through the growth of canopy roots. This storage allows nutrients to be more closely cycled through an ecosystem, and prevents nutrients from being washed out of the system.",1

All kodecytes retain their normal vitality and functionality while gaining the new function of the inserted FSL constructs. The combination of dispersibility in biocompatible media, spontaneous incorporation into cell membranes, and apparent low toxicity, makes FSL constructs suitable as research tools and for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic applications.",1

It is recommended for infants at high-risk for RSV due to conditions such as prematurity or other medical problems including heart or lung diseases.The most common side effects include fever and rash.Palivizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG) directed against an epitope in the A antigenic site of the F protein of RSV.  In two phase III clinical trials in the pediatric population, palivizumab reduced the risk of hospitalization due to RSV infection by 55% and 45%.  Palivizumab is dosed once a month via intramuscular (IM) injection, to be administered throughout the duration of the RSV season, which in based on past trends has started in Mid-September to Mid-November.Palivizumab targets the fusion protein of RSV, inhibiting its entry into the cell and thereby preventing infection. Palivizumab was approved for medical use in 1998.",1
Life Science,"H+, Na+-translocating pyrophosphatase family","Members of the H+, Na+-translocating Pyrophosphatase (M+-PPase) Family (TC# 3.A.10) are found in the vacuolar (tonoplast) membranes of higher plants, algae, and protozoa, and in both bacteria and archaea. They are therefore ancient enzymes.
Two types of inorganic diphosphatase, very different in terms of both amino acid sequence and structure, have been characterised to date: soluble and transmembrane proton-pumping pyrophosphatases (sPPases and H(+)-PPases, respectively). sPPases are ubiquitous proteins that hydrolyse pyrophosphate to release heat, whereas H+-PPases, so far unidentified in animal and fungal cells, couple the energy of PPi hydrolysis to proton movement across biological membranes. The latter type is represented by this group of proteins. H+-PPases vacuolar-type inorganic pyrophosphatases (V-PPase) or pyrophosphate-energised vacuolar membrane proton pumps. In plants, vacuoles contain two enzymes for acidifying the interior of the vacuole, the V-ATPase and the V-PPase (V is for vacuolar).Two distinct biochemical subclasses of H+-PPases have been characterised to date: K+-stimulated and K+-insensitive.",1

Life Science,Microbial rhodopsin,"Microbial rhodopsins, also known as bacterial rhodopsins are retinal-binding proteins that provide light-dependent ion transport and sensory functions in halophilic and other bacteria. They are integral membrane proteins with seven transmembrane helices, the last of which contains the attachment point (a conserved lysine) for retinal.
This protein family includes light-driven proton pumps, ion pumps and ion channels, as well as light sensors. For example, the proteins from halobacteria include bacteriorhodopsin and archaerhodopsin, which are light-driven proton pumps; halorhodopsin, a light-driven chloride pump; and sensory rhodopsin, which mediates both photoattractant (in the red) and photophobic (in the ultra-violet) responses. Proteins from other bacteria include proteorhodopsin.
Contrary to their name, microbial rhodopsins are found not only in Archaea and Bacteria, but also in Eukaryota (such as algae) and viruses; although they are rare in complex multicellular organisms.",1
Life Science,Cell culture assay,"A cell culture assay is any method used to assess the cytotoxicity of a material.  This refers to the in vitro assessment of a material to determine whether it releases toxic chemicals in the cell. It also determines if the quantity is sufficient to kill cells, either directly or indirectly, through the inhibition of cell metabolic pathways.  Cell culture evaluations are the precursor to whole animal studies and are a way to determine if significant cytotoxicity exists for the given material.  Cell culture assays are standardized by ASTM, ISO, and BSI (British Standards Institution.)

Life Science,AnIML,"Animals (also called Metazoa) are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and go through an ontogenetic stage in which their body consists of a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft). They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology.
Most living animal species are in Bilateria, a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. The Bilateria include the protostomes, containing invertebrates such as nematodes, arthropods, and molluscs, and the deuterostomes, containing the echinoderms and the chordates, the latter including the vertebrates. Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the Ediacaran biota of the late Precambrian. Many modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion, which began around 539 million years ago. 6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago.
Historically, Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without. Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical biological classification for animals in 1758 with his Systema Naturae, which Jean-Baptiste Lamarck expanded into 14 phyla by 1809. In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular Metazoa (now synonymous for Animalia) and the Protozoa, single-celled organisms no longer considered animals. In modern times, the biological classification of animals relies on advanced techniques, such as molecular phylogenetics, which are effective at demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between taxa.
Humans make use of many animal species, such as for food (including meat, milk, and eggs), for materials (such as leather and wool), as pets, and as working animals including for transport. Dogs have been used in hunting, as have birds of prey, while many terrestrial and aquatic animals were hunted for sports. Nonhuman animals have appeared in art from the earliest times and are featured in mythology and religion.",1
Life Science,Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry,"Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) is cyclic voltammetry with a very high scan rate (up to 1×106 V·s−1). Application of high scan rate allows rapid acquisition of a voltammogram within several milliseconds and ensures high temporal resolution of this electroanalytical technique. An acquisition rate of 10 Hz is routinely employed.
FSCV in combination with carbon-fiber microelectrodes became a very popular method for detection of neurotransmitters, hormones and metabolites in biological systems. Initially, FSCV was successfully used for detection of electrochemically active biogenic amines release in chromaffin cells (adrenaline and noradrenaline), brain slices (5-HT, dopamine, norepinephrine) and in vivo in anesthetized or awake and behaving animals (dopamine). Further refinements of the method have enabled detection of 5-HT, HA, norepinephrine, adenosine, oxygen, pH changes in vivo in rats and mice as well as measurement of dopamine and serotonin concentration in fruit flies.

Life Science,Cellular microarray,"A cellular microarray (or cell microarray) is a laboratory tool that allows for the multiplex interrogation of living cells on the surface of a solid support.  The support, sometimes called a ""chip"", is spotted with varying materials, such as antibodies, proteins, or lipids, which can interact with the cells, leading to their capture on specific spots.  Combinations of different materials can be spotted in a given area, allowing not only cellular capture, when a specific interaction exists, but also the triggering of a cellular response, change in phenotype, or detection of a response from the cell, such as a specific secreted factor.
There are a large number of types of cellular microarrays:

Reverse transfection cell microarrays. David M. Sabatini's laboratory developed reverse-transfection cell microarrays at the Whitehead Institute, publishing their work in 2001.
PMHC Cellular Microarrays.  This type of microarray were developed by Daniel Chen, Yoav Soen, Dan Kraft, Patrick Brown and Mark Davis at Stanford University Medical Center.",1
Life Science,Custom-made medical device,"A custom-made medical device, commonly referred to as a custom-made device (CMD) (Canada, European Union, United Kingdom) or a custom device (United States), is a medical device designed and manufactured for the sole use of a particular patient. Examples of custom-made medical devices include auricular splints, dentures, orthodontic appliances, orthotics and prostheses.",1

Life Science,COLD-PCR,"COLD-PCR (co-amplification at lower denaturation temperature PCR) is a modified polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol that enriches variant alleles from a mixture of wildtype and mutation-containing DNA. The ability to preferentially amplify and identify minority alleles and low-level somatic DNA mutations in the presence of excess wildtype alleles is useful for the detection of mutations. Detection of mutations is important in the case of early cancer detection from tissue biopsies and body fluids such as blood plasma or serum, assessment of residual disease after surgery or chemotherapy, disease staging and molecular profiling for prognosis or tailoring therapy to individual patients, and monitoring of therapy outcome and cancer remission or relapse. Common PCR will amplify both the major (wildtype) and minor (mutant) alleles with the same efficiency, occluding the ability to easily detect the presence of low-level mutations. The capacity to detect a mutation in a mixture of variant/wildtype DNA is valuable because this mixture of variant DNAs can occur when provided with a heterogeneous sample – as is often the case with cancer biopsies. Currently, traditional PCR is used in tandem with a number of different downstream assays for genotyping or the detection of somatic mutations. These can include the use of amplified DNA for RFLP analysis, MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser-desorption–time-of-flight) genotyping, or direct sequencing for detection of mutations by Sanger sequencing or pyrosequencing. Replacing traditional PCR with COLD-PCR for these downstream assays will increase the reliability in detecting mutations from mixed samples, including tumors and body fluids.

Business Administration,Management science,"Management science or Managerial Science (MS) is the broad interdisciplinary study of problem solving and decision making in human organizations, with strong links to management, economics, business, engineering, management consulting, and other fields. It uses various scientific research-based principles, strategies, and analytical methods including  mathematical modeling, statistics and numerical algorithms to improve an organization's ability to enact rational and accurate management decisions by arriving at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex decision problems.  Management science helps businesses to achieve goals using various scientific methods.
The field was initially an outgrowth of applied mathematics, where early challenges were problems relating to the optimization of systems which could be modeled linearly, i.e., determining the optima (maximum value of profit, assembly line performance, crop yield, bandwidth, etc. or minimum of loss, risk, costs, etc.) of some objective function. Today, management science encompasses any organizational activity for which a problem is structured in mathematical form to generate managerially relevant insights.",0

Business Administration,Control (management),"Control is a function of management which helps to check errors in order to take corrective actions. This is done to minimize deviation from standards and ensure that the stated goals of the organization are achieved in a desired manner.
According to modern concepts, control is a foreseeing action; earlier concepts of control were only used when errors were detected. Control in management includes setting standards, measuring actual performance and taking corrective action in decision making.",0
Business Administration,Seagull management,"Seagull management is a management style wherein a manager only interacts with employees when they deem a problem has arisen. The perception is that such a management style involves hasty decisions about things of which they have little understanding, resulting in a messy situation with which others must deal.The term became popular through a joke in Ken Blanchard’s 1985 book Leadership and the One Minute Manager: “Seagull managers fly in, make a lot of noise, dump on everyone, then fly out.”",0
Business Administration,Management due diligence,"Management due diligence is the process of appraising a company's senior management—evaluating each individual's effectiveness in contributing to the organization's strategic objectives.Assessing company management is crucial when closing business deals. It can mean the difference between long-term success or sudden failure. It also helps the organisation understand how the teams perform their roles in context with the company's future business plan. This helps clarify the structure of the organisation's work-force.
The management due diligence process can be identified as an informative tool for external stakeholders, and can also be referred to as Management Assessment as it addresses the team’s dynamics and highlight the risks.",0

Business Administration,Joy's law (management),"In management, Joy's law is the principle that ""no matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else,” attributed to Sun Microsystems co-founder Bill Joy. Joy was prompted to state this observation through his dislike of Bill Gates' view of ""Microsoft as an IQ monopolist."" He argued that, instead, ""It's better to create an ecology that gets all the world’s smartest people toiling in your garden for your goals. If you rely solely on your own employees, you’ll never solve all your customers' needs."" Core to this principle is the definition of smart within the context of the quotation. Smart ""refers to capability but not willingness to work for someone."" Furthermore, ""the fact that you are smart for one company does not make you smart for another."" Richard Pettinger, Director of Information Management for Business, UCL   The law highlights an essential problem that is faced by many modern businesses, ""that in any given sphere of activity most of the pertinent knowledge will reside outside the boundaries of any one organization, and the central challenge [is] to find ways to access that knowledge.""In computing, the same Bill Joy devised a simple mathematical function regarding the increase in microprocessor speed over time which is also referred to as Joy's Law.",0
Business Administration,Sense and respond,"Sense and respond has been used in control theory for several decades, primarily in closed systems such as refineries where comparisons are made between measurements and desired values, and system settings are adjusted to narrow the gap between the two. Since  the early 1980s, sense and respond has also been used to describe the behavior of certain open systems. 
Sense and respond is based on lean principles and follows URSLIMM:

U - understand customer value
R - remove waste
S - standardize
L - learn by doing
I - involve everyone
M - measure what matters
M - manage performance visuallyThe term ""sense and respond"" as a business concept was used in a 1992 American Management Association Management Review article by Stephan H. Haeckel.  It was developed by Haeckel at IBM’s Advanced Business Institute.",0
Business Administration,Innovation leadership,"Innovation leadership is a philosophy and technique that combines different leadership styles to influence employees to produce creative ideas, products, and services. The key role in the practice of innovation leadership is the innovation leader. Dr. David Gliddon (2006) developed the competency model of innovation leaders and established the concept of innovation leadership at Penn State University.
As an approach to organization development, innovation leadership can support achievement of the mission or the vision of an organization or group. With new technologies and processes, it is necessary for organizations to think innovatively to ensure continued success and stay competitive. to adapt to new changes, “The need for innovation in organizations has resulted in a new focus on the role of leaders in shaping the nature and success of creative efforts.” Without innovation leadership, organizations are likely to struggle. This new call for innovation represents the shift from the 20th century, traditional view of organizational practices, which discouraged employee innovative behaviors, to the 21st-century view of valuing innovative thinking as a “potentially powerful influence on organizational performance.”",0
